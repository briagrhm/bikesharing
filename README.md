## Overview 
This analysis was done to create visulaization adds so that investors could see that a citibike app was a good investment move. 

## Results 

The results show that citibike is used significantly more by males than females. This is shown by looking at trip duration based on gender. This also can be shown by looking at the bikers by gender.

The most popular time for citibikes to be used is during peak work travel hours which is usuall around 8am to 5pm. This is shown by looking at the trips by weekday per hour. On the weekends there doesnt seem to be a significant time for bike use it is spread throughout the day. Stop times also coincide with the theory that the bikes are used alot during work travel hours.

## Summary 
The results show that the citibike app could be promising. Des Moines seems to be a high traffick area with alot of male bike users and it seems to be used during work hours mostly and heavily on towards the end of the week on thursdays and fridays. Future analysis could be done on the area looking at which area in Des Moines has the highest traffic for citibike, that could potentially help with making more bikes available or developing more pick up spots. Another analysis could be done to look at the areas that the subscribers mostly frequent to determine if their is a correlation with high traffic areas and user type.
